    "#### Overview  \n",
    "This notebook focuses on forecasting player performance for Partizan Mozzart Bet Belgrade’s 2022/23 roster by predicting points scored in a game using historical data. I developed regression models - Linear Regression and Random Forest - to predict points based on features like playing time, recent performance, game phase, and home/away status. Additionally, I built player-specific models for key players **Kevin Punter** and **Mathias Lessort** to capture individual trends. The goal is to identify the best predictive approach, providing actionable insights for game planning and strategy optimization."

    "#### General Models\n",
    "- Linear Regression (R²=0.36, RMSE=5.41) outperforms Random Forest (R²=0.29, RMSE=5.70), providing a solid baseline for predicting points across all players.\n",
    "- Playing time (`total_seconds`) is the most significant predictor in both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Player-Specific Models\n",
    "- **Kevin Punter**: The tailored model excels (R²=0.61, RMSE=3.59), capturing his scoring trends effectively and improving over the general model.\n",
    "- **Mathias Lessort**: The model performs poorly (R²=-0.27, RMSE=4.24), suggesting his scoring is influenced by factors beyond the current features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Insights\n",
    "- Home advantage and playoff intensity impact scoring, with varying effects across players.\n",
    "- Recent performance (`points_previous_game`) often shows a negative coefficient, indicating variability or regression to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Implications\n",
    "- **Game Planning**: Use Punter’s model for reliable predictions (e.g., adjust minutes to target specific scoring outputs).\n",
    "- **Team Strategy**: Leverage home advantage (especially for Lessort) and prepare for playoff intensity (notably for Punter’s scoring boost)."
