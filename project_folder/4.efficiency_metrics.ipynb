    "### Overview  \n",
    "This notebook provides a consolidated analysis of Partizan Mozzart Bet Belgrade’s player performance in the 2022-2023 EuroLeague season, based on six key efficiency metrics:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Shooting Percentage (TS%)**: Measures shooting efficiency, factoring in 2-point, 3-point, and free-throw shots.  \n",
    "- **Points per 32 Minutes (PP32)**: Normalizes scoring output to a standard 32-minute playing time.  \n",
    "- **Assist-to-Turnover Ratio (AST/TO)**: Assesses playmaking efficiency by comparing assists to turnovers.  \n",
    "- **Usage Rate (USG%)**: Percentage of team possessions a player uses, adjusted for time on court.  \n",
    "- **Points per Possession (PPP)**: Scoring efficiency per possession used.  \n",
    "- **Rebound Rate (REB%)**: Percentage of available team rebounds a player secures, adjusted for minutes."

    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**  \n",
    "- **Scoring Efficiency:** Lessort leads in TS% (0.721486) and PPP (1.232044), indicating he’s the most efficient scorer on the team. He maximizes points per possession and shoots effectively across all types of shots (2-pointers, 3-pointers, and free throws).  \n",
    "- **Rebounding:** His REB% of 16.606726 is the highest on the team, showing he’s a dominant rebounder, likely playing a big man role (e.g., center or power forward). This makes him crucial for securing second-chance opportunities and defending the paint.  \n",
    "- **Usage:** A USG% of 9.040352 (3rd) suggests he’s a significant part of the offense but not the primary ball-handler, allowing him to focus on high-efficiency plays like post-ups, putbacks, and free throws.  \n",
    "- **Scoring Rate:** His PP32 of 12.758641 is solid but not elite, indicating he’s not a high-volume scorer but makes the most of his opportunities.  \n",
    "- **Role:** Lessort is likely a highly efficient big man who anchors the team’s interior presence. His ability to score efficiently, rebound at a high rate, and contribute to the offense without needing the ball too often makes him a cornerstone of the team’s frontcourt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Punter Kevin  \n",
    "**Metrics:**  \n",
    "- TS%: 0.623184 (3rd)  \n",

    "- **Usage:** His USG% of 13.644535 is the highest on the team, indicating he’s the focal point of the offense, handling the ball frequently and taking on a large share of the team’s possessions.  \n",
    "- **Playmaking:** An AST/TO ratio of 1.844144 (2nd) shows he’s an effective playmaker, balancing assists with minimal turnovers. This suggests he’s not just a scorer but also a creator for his teammates.  \n",
    "- **Scoring Efficiency:** His TS% (0.623184) and PPP (1.126225) are strong, ranking 3rd in both, meaning he’s efficient despite his high usage.  \n",
    "- **Rebounding:** A REB% of 5.821043 is decent for a guard or wing, showing he contributes on the boards, though it’s not his primary role.  \n",
    "- **Role:** Punter is likely the team’s primary scoring guard (e.g., shooting guard or point guard), serving as the offensive engine. His high usage, scoring rate, and playmaking ability make him a go-to player in clutch situations, while his efficiency ensures he’s not just a volume shooter.\n",

    "### Team Insights and Strategic Implications  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offensive Balance  \n",
    "- **Punter Kevin** and **Exum Dante** form a dynamic backcourt, combining high usage, scoring, and playmaking. They can drive the offense, create their own shots, and set up teammates.  \n",
    "- **Lessort Mathias** provides an efficient scoring option in the paint, complementing the guards’ perimeter play. His high TS% and PPP make him a reliable target for lobs, post-ups, and second-chance points.  \n",
    "- **Leday Zach**’s high usage is valuable, but his lower efficiency suggests he might benefit from better shot selection or more off-ball opportunities created by the guards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rebounding Strength  \n",
    "- **Lessort Mathias** and **Leday Zach** anchor the team’s rebounding, with REB% values of 16.606726 and 12.978675, respectively. This gives Partizan a strong presence on the boards, crucial for controlling the game’s tempo and securing extra possessions.  \n",
    "- The guards (**Punter**, **Exum**, **Nunnally**) contribute modestly to rebounding, which is a bonus for their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Playmaking  \n",
    "- **Exum Dante** and **Punter Kevin** lead in AST/TO, ensuring the team has reliable facilitators. This allows for a balanced offense where the ball moves efficiently, creating opportunities for players like Lessort and Smailagic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Areas for Improvement  \n",
    "- **Leday Zach’s Efficiency:** His high usage (11.260251) paired with lower TS% (0.587875) and PPP (1.062734) suggests he might be forcing shots. The team could design plays to get him easier looks, such as pick-and-rolls with Punter or Exum.  \n",
    "- **Rebounding from Guards:** While Punter, Exum, and Nunnally contribute to rebounding, the team might benefit from more effort on the boards from the backcourt to support Lessort and Leday.  \n",
    "- **Depth Scoring:** **Smailagic Alen** and **Avramovic Aleksa** provide scoring off the bench, but their efficiency (TS%, PPP) isn’t as high as the starters. Developing their consistency could help maintain offensive output when the starters rest."

    "### Recommendations  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximize Lessort’s Touches in the Paint:** Lessort’s elite efficiency (TS%, PPP) and rebounding (REB%) make him a key weapon. The team should prioritize getting him the ball in high-percentage situations, such as post-ups, lobs, and offensive rebounds.  \n",
    "- **Leverage Punter and Exum’s Versatility:** Punter and Exum should continue to lead the offense, balancing their scoring with playmaking. Stagger their minutes to ensure one of them is always on the court to maintain offensive flow.  \n",
    "- **Improve Leday’s Shot Selection:** Leday’s high usage is valuable, but his efficiency needs improvement. The team could run more plays to get him open looks, such as screens or cuts, rather than relying on him to create his own shots.  \n",
    "- **Encourage Guard Rebounding:** Punter, Exum, and Nunnally should be encouraged to crash the boards more often, especially on defense, to support Lessort and Leday. This could help the team dominate rebounding margins.  \n",
    "- **Develop Bench Scoring:** Smailagic Alen and Avramovic Aleksa are solid bench scorers, but their efficiency could improve. The team might focus on integrating them into the offense with set plays to boost their confidence and consistency."
